# Deployment Documentation

The `wrixle-portfolio-manager` project can be deployed using Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for container orchestration. This document provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the application in a production environment.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the application, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Docker installed on the deployment server or cluster nodes.
2. Kubernetes installed and configured on the deployment server or cluster nodes.
3. Docker images for the frontend and backend applications pushed to a container registry accessible by Kubernetes.

## Step 1: Prepare Configuration Files

Update the configuration files:

- `development.js`: Update development-specific environment variables and settings.
- `production.js`: Update production-specific environment variables and settings.

## Step 2: Build and Push Docker Images

Build the Docker images for the frontend and backend applications:

```bash
docker build -t frontend-app:latest ./path/to/frontend
docker build -t backend-app:latest ./path/to/backend
```

Push the Docker images to the container registry:

```bash
docker push registry.example.com/frontend-app:latest
docker push registry.example.com/backend-app:latest
```

## Step 3: Create Kubernetes Deployment Manifests

Create Kubernetes deployment manifests for both the frontend and backend applications. These manifests should specify the container images, environment variables, and resource limits.

Create a Kubernetes service manifest to expose the backend application's API endpoints to the frontend.

## Step 4: Deploy with Kubernetes

Apply the Kubernetes deployment and service manifests:

```bash
kubectl apply -f frontend-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f backend-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f backend-service.yaml
```

Verify that the Kubernetes pods are running and the services are exposed:

```bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services
```

Set up Ingress or load balancer (if applicable) to access the application from outside the cluster.

## Step 5: Monitor and Scale

Monitor the application's performance and resource usage using Kubernetes monitoring tools.

Scale the application by adjusting the number of replicas for the frontend and backend deployments as needed.

## Step 6: Rolling Updates

Perform rolling updates to deploy new versions of the application:

```bash
kubectl set image deployment/frontend-app frontend-app=registry.example.com/frontend-app:new_version
kubectl set image deployment/backend-app backend-app=registry.example.com/backend-app:new_version
```

Monitor the update progress using Kubernetes rolling update status:

```bash
kubectl rollout status deployment/frontend-app
kubectl rollout status deployment/backend-app
```

## Step 7: Backup and Recovery

Set up a backup strategy for the application data and databases.

Create a disaster recovery plan for the entire deployment.

## Conclusion

This deployment documentation provides guidelines for deploying the wrixle-portfolio-manager project in a production environment using Docker and Kubernetes. Following these steps will ensure a scalable and maintainable deployment of the application.
