# Architecture Overview

The `wrixle-portfolio-manager` is a web application designed to manage portfolios and assets for users interested in cryptocurrency and investments. This document provides an overview of the architecture used in the project.

## Frontend Architecture

The frontend of the application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It follows a component-based architecture, where each UI element is encapsulated within a React component. The project's frontend architecture consists of the following key components:

1. **Components**: The `components` directory contains reusable and standalone UI components used throughout the application. These components are responsible for rendering specific UI elements and are structured in a way that promotes reusability and maintainability.

2. **Pages**: The `pages` directory contains React components that represent different pages of the application. Each page is a composition of multiple UI components and handles the layout and logic specific to that page.

3. **Services**: The `services` directory houses various service modules responsible for interacting with backend APIs, managing authentication, and handling Ethereum-related operations.

4. **Utils**: The `utils` directory contains utility functions used across the application. These functions handle common tasks such as date formatting, data validation, and data manipulation.

5. **Assets**: The `assets` directory contains image files, icons, and fonts used in the frontend.

6. **App.js**: The `App.js` file is the main entry point of the frontend application. It sets up the routing and overall structure of the application.

7. **index.js**: The `index.js` file serves as the entry point to render the `App` component into the DOM.

## Backend Architecture

The backend of the application is designed using Node.js and Express, a popular web framework for Node.js. The backend architecture is organized as follows:

1. **API Routes**: The backend defines several API routes to handle various functionalities, including portfolio management, asset data retrieval, and user authentication. These routes are defined using Express Router.

2. **Controllers**: The `controllers` directory contains handler functions for each API route. These controllers process incoming requests, interact with the database, and send appropriate responses back to the client.

3. **Models**: The `models` directory defines the data models and schemas used by the application. It interacts with the database and provides a structured way to access and manipulate data.

4. **Services**: The `services` directory contains additional business logic that goes beyond basic CRUD operations. It includes services for Ethereum-related interactions, external API calls, and user authentication.

5. **Configurations**: The `config` directory contains environment-specific configuration files such as `development.js` and `production.js`, which store various environment variables and settings.

## Deployment Architecture

The deployment of the `wrixle-portfolio-manager` project is typically done using containerization with Docker and container orchestration using Kubernetes. This allows for easier scalability and manageability in a production environment.

The frontend and backend applications are containerized using Docker images, and Kubernetes is used to deploy and manage the application across different pods and nodes.

## Conclusion

The `wrixle-portfolio-manager` project's architecture is designed to be modular, scalable, and maintainable. It leverages popular technologies and best practices to create a user-friendly and efficient portfolio management application.
